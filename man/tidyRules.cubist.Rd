\title{Obtain rules as a tidy tibble from a cubist model}
\usage{
\method{tidyRules}{cubist}(object, col_classes = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{Fitted model object with rules}

\item{col_classes}{Named list or a named character vector of column classes.
Column names of the data used for modeling form the names and the
respective classes for the value. One way of obtaining this is by running
`lapply(data, class)`.}

\item{...}{Other arguments (currently unused)}
}
\value{
A tibble where each row corresponds to a rule. The columns are:
  support, mean, min, max, error, lhs, rhs and committee
}
\description{
Each row corresponds to a rule. A rule can be copied into
  `dplyr::filter` to filter the observations corresponding to a rule
}
\details{
When col_classes argument is missing, an educated guess is made
about class by parsing the RHS of sub-rule. This might sometimes not lead to
a parsable rule.
}
\examples{
data("attrition", package = "rsample")
attrition <- tibble::as_tibble(attrition)
cols_att <- setdiff(colnames(attrition), c("MonthlyIncome", "Attrition"))

cb_att <-
  Cubist::cubist(x = attrition[, cols_att],y = attrition[["MonthlyIncome"]])
tr_att <- tidyRules(cb_att)
tr_att
